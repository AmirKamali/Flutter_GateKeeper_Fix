# GateKeeper fix for Flutter 
This script helps to fix the flutter issues with recent MacOSX such as Catalina. You might be prompted to enter the system password since with admin permission.


Some errors you might get while using flutter for the first time:

“dart” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
“idevicename” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
“idevicescreenshot” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
“idevicesyslog” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.


# How to use:
```
Example : ./gate-keeper.sh ~/Documents/flutter
```

It is recommended to reboot the systems to apply changes after running the script.
